MetaVanish – Metadata Remover for Privacy-Conscious Users
---------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for installing MetaVanish.

MetaVanish is a lightweight privacy tool built to help individuals, professionals, and organizations remove hidden metadata from images and PDF files — before they’re shared with the world.

Why it matters:
---------------
Metadata (like device info, timestamps, GPS location, author names) often gets embedded inside files silently. When you share documents or images online, this hidden data could unintentionally expose personal or confidential details.

MetaVanish ensures your files are stripped of these invisible footprints — preserving your right to digital privacy.

What MetaVanish can do:
------------------------
✓ Detect and display embedded metadata in JPEG, PNG, and PDF files  
✓ Strip hidden metadata in a single click  
✓ Save clean versions of your files without altering content  
✓ Easy-to-use, fast, and built for everyday users

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open MetaVanish  
2. Browse and select an image or PDF  
3. Click “View Metadata” to inspect hidden data  
4. Click “Strip Metadata” to remove it and save a clean version
